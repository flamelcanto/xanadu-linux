Reportando un error
-------------------

Si usted encontró un error mientras utiliza Xanadu GNU/Linux y desea reportarlo, primero busque en la lista de reportes [issue](https://github.com/xanadu-linux/xanadu-tracker/issues) para ver si su error ya esta entre ellos (incluya los reportes cerrados)

Si su error no ha sido reportado, cree un nuevo issue incluyendo la siguiente información:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your system information.\*

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com) if they are lengthy. Information on log locations what what do with them, can be found on [wiki](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/wiki/Reviewing-log-information). 

Conduct
-------


There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Steam.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.
